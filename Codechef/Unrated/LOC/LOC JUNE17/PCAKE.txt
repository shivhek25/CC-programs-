Little Chef doesn't like repeated things. He calls a number n Good if there are no repeating prime factors in its prime decomposition.
Little Chef has just won the best chef award. There is a huge cake with N pieces arranged in a single row. Each piece of cake was made by a different chef; so each piece i has a score Ai associated with it. The score of multiple pieces of cake is the product of the scores of the individual pieces.
As prize for winning the best chef award, Little Chef can choose any contiguous part of the cake and eat it. In how many ways can little chef choose this part such that the score of that part is Good?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of pieces in the cake. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the score of each piece.


Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways chef can choose a contiguous part of the cake such that the score is good.


Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5x105


Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points)
