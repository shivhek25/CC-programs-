The Riddler has a simple question for you. You have to tell him the count of numbers between A and B (A<=B)which are divisible by M.

For every test case , print the answer in a new line.
Input
The first line contains an integer T, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains A, B and M respectively as described above.

Output
For every test case print the answer in a new line.

Constraints
