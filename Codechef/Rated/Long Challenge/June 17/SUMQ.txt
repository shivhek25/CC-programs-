Given a triplet of integers (X , Y , Z), such that X ≤ Y and Y ≥ Z, we define f(X , Y , Z) to be (X + Y) * (Y + Z). If either X > Y or Y < Z, or both, then f(X , Y , Z) is defined to be 0.

You are provided three arrays A , B and C of any length (their lengths may or may not be equal).

Your task is to find the sum of f(X , Y , Z) over all triplets (X, Y , Z) where X, Y and Z belong to A, B and C respectively.

Output your sum for each test case modulo 1000000007.

Input
The first line contains a single integer, T, which is the number of test cases. The description of each testcase follows:
The first line of each testcase contains 3 integers: p, q and r. These denote the lengths of A,B and C respectively.
The second line contains p integers, which are the elements of A
The third line contains q integers, which are the elements of B
The fourth line contains r integers, which are the elements of C
Output
Output the required sum modulo 1000000007 for each test case in a new line.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ p, q, r ≤ 100000
1 ≤ every array element ≤ 1000000000
Subtasks
