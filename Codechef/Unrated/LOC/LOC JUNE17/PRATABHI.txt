Pratzz and Abhi are roommates. Pratzz will throw Abhi out of the room if he fails to answer this question. Please help him stay in the room by answering the queries. Formally stating, there is an array A given initially of size N. All the array elements are initially 0.Array is 1-indexed.Based on that, you have to process 'Q' queries.Each query can be of 2 types:

1 i a - For this, you have to update the array element at ith index of array to 'a'.
2 k - To answer this query, we generate a new array S of the same size as given array A.
The description of array S is mentioned below :

S[1]=A[1] when i=1
S[i]=A[i] | S[i-1] when i>1 and i<=n .| denotes bitwise OR operator.

We need to find a whether a subset of array S exists whose XOR is equal to 'k'. For example, suppose the elements of a subset of array S is {S[1],S[3],S[4]}, then XOR of the subset = S[1]^S[3]^S[4].

The answer to this query should be either "YES" if we can find a subset of S whose XOR is equal to 'k' or "NO" otherwise.

Note: Assume XOR of empty subset to be 0.

Input
The first line of input contains N, denoting the number of elements in A and Q, the number of queries. Next Q lines will contain the Q queries described above.

Output
For each query of type 2, answer "YES" or "NO" in a new line..
