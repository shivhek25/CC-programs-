Harry and Hermione are playing a game in which Hermione challenges Harry by giving an array A and a number S, and asks to provide an efficient magical algorithm to find a number K from array A such that if all elements in A greater than K are changed to K, the sum of all elements in the resulting array will be S.

Now harry has to find that magical number K. So help out harry in this task.
Input
The first line contains an integer T, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines. First line of each test case consists of two numbers represting N and S. Second line of each test case consists of n integers represting array A.

Output
If there exists the number K print in a new line, else print "-1" (without inverted comma). If more than one K is possible, then print the minimum one.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 2*104
1 ≤ S ≤ 1011
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
Subtaks
Subtask #1 [30 points]: 1 ≤ N≤ 102 & 1 ≤ S≤ 108
Subtask #2 [70 points]: No additional constraints
