Alice has quarreled with Chef recently. So Chef gives a problem to Alice.
Initially you are given an empty string and are allowed following two operations.
Operation-1 : Every 'a' becomes 'c' and every 'c' becomes 'a'. For example, "acc" becomes "caa".
Operation-2 : String is reversed. For Example, "acc" becomes "cca".

Chef gives following generating equation SN = SN-1 + "a" + Operation-1(Operation-2(SN-1))
where S0 = "" (empty string). Alice easily finds out next few sequences as:
S1 = "a"
S2 = "aac"
S3 = "aacaacc"
Now Chef asks to find Kth character of SLOC, where LOC = 102017. You need to help Alice find the answer.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each of the next T lines contains a number K.


Output
For each test case, output a single character ('a' or 'c') containing answer of problem asked by Chef".


Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
Subtask 1(20 points):1 ≤ K ≤ 105.
Subtask 2(80 points):1 ≤ K ≤ 1018.


Example
Input:
3
